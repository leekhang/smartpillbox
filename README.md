# Smart Pill Box

This project was designed to provide smart functionality for a pill box. This prototype smart pill container reminds the user daily when itâ€™s time to take their medicine. In essence, this smart pillbox improves on existing pillboxes by letting the user set times for each medication and get visual alerts when it's time.

This prototype uses a simple web interface for the user to input up to 3 medicines and the times when they should be taken. When the time is up for one of the medications, the touchscreen will show a quick reminder message and an LED on that specific medicine compartment will gently glow to indicate which compartment it is. Figure 1 shows the prototype in action.
